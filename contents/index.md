*Looking for remote job*

Hi, I'm **Alexey Zubritskiy**
==============================
Senior Software Engineer, Architect, Blockchain Specialist
----------------------------------------------------------

I am a passionate programmer—and I mean it. I love challenging tasks and difficult problems. I started writing code before I even had a device to run it on, and I have never stopped since. I enjoy overcoming hardware and software limitations. I love learning new technologies inside and out, embracing their methodologies, and creating exceptional products with them.

I have replaced the core of a complex system while it was running at full capacity. I have designed new systems from scratch. I have worked across diverse environments—from calculators and mobile devices to cloud platforms and supercomputers.

For me, programming is more than a job or a hobby—it is a way of life.
