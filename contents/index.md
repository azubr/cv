Hi, I'm **Alexey Zubritskiy!**
==============================
Software Engineer, Architect
----------------------------

I'm a passionate programmer. I mean it. I love challenging tasks and hard problems. I started writing code even having no device to execute it and never stopped since that. I enjoy overcoming limitations of hardware and software. I have fun in learning a new technology inside and out, adopting its way of doing things, and making new exceptional products with it. 

I've replaced heart of complex system while it was running full throttle. I've architected new systems from scratch. I dealed with various environments from calculators and phones to clouds and supercomputers. 

Programming is not only my job and my hobby. It's my lifestyle.
