Blockchain technologies
==================
Smart contracts, DeFi, Chain indexing
------------------------------

Blockchains look like a gimmick at first glance. But making transactions in zero-trust environment is real and very valuable feature. Another challenge lies in extracting insights from all those transactions.


Functional and reactive programming
===================================
Haskel, Scala, Akka, RxJS
-----------------------------

Composition of High order functions folds and ties data flow in unbelievable ways.
It is just a new world where you learn programming from scratch.


Low-level software
==================
EVM
---
Ethereum virtual machine gives very limited computation power to for smart contracts. And it is great challenge to optimize a complex calculation working directly with opcodes and storage slots. 

Rust
----
Rust is the way to safe and blazing fast calculations on almost bare hardware.
I'd like to make a tiny ADs filtering proxy server capable to work on routers and even 3g modems.
