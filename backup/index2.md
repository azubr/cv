Hi, I'm ** *Alexey Zubritskiy*!**
==============================
Software Engineer, Architect
----------------------------

I'm a passionate programmer. I mean it. I love challenging tasks and difficult problems. I started writing code even when I had no device to execute it and never stopped since then. I enjoy overcoming hardware and software limitations. I have fun in learning a new technology inside and out, adopting its way of doing things, and making exceptional new products with it. 

I've replaced the heart of a complex system while it was running full throttle. I've designed new systems from scratch. I've dealt with various environmentsâ€”from calculators and phones to clouds and supercomputers. 

Programming is not only my job and my hobby. It is my lifestyle.
